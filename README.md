# RaspberryPiCluster
Config files for a Haddop + Spark + Postgresql raspberry cluster (ubuntu 20.04)

This repository contains the filesystem structure for two nodes - P1 (master) and P2 (worker)
The only files I am going to save are the ones required for configuring the server (networking) and the servers.
