# RaspberryPiCluster

Config files for a Haddop + Spark + Hive  + Kafka + Postgresql raspberry cluster (ubuntu 20.04)

The files in this repository are the ones you need to create/update in order to set up your cluster.

I did it in a raspberry pi 4 4gb cluster (3 nodes), but any instalation with enough resournces should do - such as virtual machines.
